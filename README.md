# Arrays Mini Lab 2

## Directions

1. Declare a new array called music and inside its store 3 musical artists you like to listen to.

2. Insert a new artist onto the end of the array using an array method we recently learned. 

3. Create a string stored in a variable called sentence that reads “My favorite artists are “… including all the contents of your music array into the string with each array item in the string joined by a comma and space ', '.

4. Run the tests from terminal by typing npm run test

## Bonus

5. Visit: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
